Information retrieval (IR) is the activity of obtaining information system resources that are relevant to an information need from a collection of those resources. Searches can be based on full-text or other content-based indexing. Information retrieval is the science of searching for information in a document, searching for documents themselves, and also searching for the metadata that describes data, and for databases of texts, images or sounds

The (standard) Boolean model of information retrieval (BIR) is a classical information retrieval (IR) model and, at the same time, the first and most-adopted one. It is used by many IR systems to this day.The BIR is based on Boolean logic and classical set theory in that both the documents to be searched and the userâ€™s query are conceived as sets of terms. Retrieval is based on whether or not the documents contain the query terms.[2]
